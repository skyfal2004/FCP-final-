# Defuant Model Network 

## Overview
This script simulates the formation and evolution of opinions within a small-world network using the Deffuant model. 

## Features Description
### Network Construction
- Constructs a 'small_world_network' using the `make_small_world_network` function, characterized by high mean clustering co-efficients and short mean path lengths.
- The number of nodes (N) and the rewiring probability of each node's connections (re_wire_prob) are configurable.

### Opinion Update Process
- In each iteration, each node randomly selects a neighbor and compares the difference in opinions.
- If the difference is less than the threshold , the opinions of both nodes are adjusted through the coupling to reduce discrepancies.
- The average value of all nodes' opinions is recorded and plotted to show its evolution over iterations.

### Visualization
- Uses the matplotlib library to plot the evolution of the average opinion value throughout the iterations, providing a visual representation of opinion dynamics.
